# Handwritten-Digit-Recongnition
A basic python Neural Network model using tensorflow to predict handwritten digits.

## Project Description
This is a basic python neural network project which creates a Sequential neural network using tensorflow library. The model is trained based on predefined mnist dataset available in tensorflow. The model has one input(Flatten) layer, two hidden(Dense) layers and final output(Dense) layer. The model predicts digits with more than 95% accuracy.
